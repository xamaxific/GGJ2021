      thing. \\nAlways fussing about the rules. Never thought she\u2019d actually
      come with us. \\nLast night, though, she came into the boathouse and she was
      completely different. \\nDetermination on her face. A <color=#91e6c0><b>straw

      hunk of junk. \\nI shouldn't have asked Ren to make it, but I was desperate.
      I'd built this thing from wreckage. You know, pieces that drifted through the
      stormwall. \\nI wouldn't have asked. Ren could have got caught. But... I had
      to. I had to because... \\nBecause... yes...because I have to see my family

      live on the island, you know. \\nI was a fisherman. I had a family. A little
      girl.  \\nA current pulled me to the storm, the ship splintered, and I woke
      up... well.  \\On the island. \\nThat star. That star reminds me I am living
      under the same sky as my daughter.... "

      Thank you for getting the cogs in my brain turning again! . \\nThat <b>blue
      star</b> will be our guide, and the <b>propeller</b> will speed us on.  \\nI
      do hope my family are out there. That\u2019s all I can do, I suppose. Hope.
      \\nBack to the wheel! "
