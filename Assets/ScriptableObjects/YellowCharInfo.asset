    m_keywordInfo: The bird? No time for her. Makes herself sad. \nAlways looking
      after this old lady in her dorm. \nOne day the bird comes into the Soup House.
      Asks me for food to give this lady. Barely enough food to feed the workers,
      let alone the dying. \nStill. I make it. The bird reads her <color=#91e6c0><b>book
      of stories</color></b>. Always reading that book. Not a realist.

    m_keywordInfo: 'Triggs? Known him for years. Whenever he''d stop tinkering in
      that boathouse of his, we''d go for walks. \nYears ago now... we stopped on
      the hills around the town. He pointed up at <color=#91e6c0><b>the blue star</color></b>.
      He said, "that star means so much to me, but I can''t say why." \nThought about
      that for days.   '

    m_keywordInfo: 'How to get soup off your fur? \nWeird question. \nIt''s easy.
      Every single day I had soup lodged in the fur.  \nYou just step out behind
      the kitchen, and into the cold sea. Comes right off. \nI was out there the
      other night. Floating in the water, looking back at the kitchen. \nWhat if
      I just left?  '

      and wrapped up warm, \nWoe to those who try to leave \nThe City Circled by
      Storm" \n \nWell. I guess we didn''t follow that advice, did we, little one?
      Ha... '

    m_keywordInfo: "Hahaha. It\u2019s all so silly, isn\u2019t it. \\nAll these <b>songs</b>,
      all these rules, all this <b>soup</b> clogging my fur, holding me down. \\nHad
      to get out. Had to unlearn it all. \\nThanks little one. You are clever. \\nBetter
      get back to shoveling coal. Leave the past behind. Eyes on the horizon. "
